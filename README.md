If I upload something that you own to this repo and you want it taken down dm me on discord (SkibbbityBop#4506) and give me proof you own it and I'll take it down as soon as I can. Thank you!

***

This is the public version of my private VRC archive where I put all of the clients, tools, etc. that I have. This version will only have things that are public and free, so I won't post any paid (BEv4, VRGreen, etc.) or private (EggClient, CRXC, etc. ) things here unless they're leaked/cracked previously by someone else (unless the dev/owner ask me to take it down)

***

**Midnight** - One of the best Quest clients out there (OLD UI)

**Shadow** - This is one of the better public quest clients, though you may not want to use it (OLD UI)

**A.R.E.S.dll** - This is the A.R.E.S client that Void leaked, face injector will work (EAC BYPASS)

**BE4v.dll** - This is the most recent Blaze Engine DLL, fairly barebones but it's what most clients now are based off of (EAC BYPASS)

**InsomniaLoader.dll** - I got this from [HyperV's website,](https://www.hvl.gg/Insomnia) but I don't really know what it is, so here it is so you can pick through it if you want to 

**MyEpicTestMod.dll** - This is required to get modded VRC on a Quest to work, you can get it from [here](https://github.com/gompoc/MyEpicTestMod)

**OculusBypass.dll** - I don't know what this is ngl, Foonix gave this to someone in The Network, and they gave it to the server. Look through it if you want, idk what it is

**PsychoticClient_Deob.dll** - This is a partially deobfuscated version of the Psychotic Client dll, you can't use this version, but you can download a working version of it [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1036021988864569495/1038883888224800768/PsychoticClient.dll). Face will work to inject it. (EAC BYPASS)
