This is the public version of my private VRC archive where I put all of the clients, tools, etc. that I have. This version will only have things that are public and free, so I won't post any paid (BEv4, VRGreen, etc.) or private (EggClient, CRXC, etc. ) things here unless they're leaked/cracked previously by someone else (unless the dev/owner ask me to take it down)

***

Midnight - One of the best Quest clients out there (OLD UI)

Shadow - This is one of the better public quest clients, though you may not want to use it

GenesisClient.dll - An old, private Quest client that probably doesn't work anymore, but it's here for picking through code and stuff like that

InsomniaLoader.dll - I got this from [HyperV's website,](https://www.hvl.gg/Insomnia) but I don't really know what it is, so here it is so you can pick through it if you want to

MyEpicTestMod.dll - This is required to get modded VRC on a Quest to work, you can get it from [here](https://github.com/gompoc/MyEpicTestMod)

OculusBypass.dll - I don't know what this is ngl, Foonix gave this to someone in The Network, and they gave it to the server. Look through it if you want, idk what it is

PsychoticClient.dll - This is a cracked post-EAC Client, idk what injector to use with it but [face](https://github.com/KANKOSHEV/face-injector-v2)

SerenityLoader.dll - This is the loader for the pre-EAC bot client Serenity, but it's obfuscated, so you're welcome to pick through it if you can deob it

emmVRC-Quest.zip - This is just a Quest port of EmmVRC done by Cyril
